        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs by grouping related data and actions together into objects. Each object represents something real — like a person, a car, or a student — and has attributes and methods.\n",
        "  - Attributes (data) → describe the object (e.g., name, age, color)\n",
        "  - Methods (functions) → describe what the object can do (e.g., run, study, start)\n",
        "- OOP makes programs easier to manage, reuse, and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "- It defines the structure (data) and behavior (functions) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world example created from the class blueprint and it actually holds the data and can perform actions defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction means hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Payment:\n",
        "      def pay(self):  #Subclass must implement this method\n",
        "          pass\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- Encapsulation means bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some parts of it.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Account:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "        self.__balance = balance  # private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amount\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods) are special built-in methods in Python that start and end with two underscores (__).\n",
        "- They are also called magic methods because they allow classes to behave like built-in types and define how objects interact with Python’s syntax and operators.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Book:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, title, author):\n",
        "          self.title = title\n",
        "          self.author = author\n",
        "\n",
        "      def __str__(self):   # defines how the object is displayed as a string\n",
        "          return f\"{self.title} by {self.author}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  book1 = Book(\"Python Basics\", \"Mark Lutz\")\n",
        "  print(book1)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance is allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "- It helps in code reusability, maintaining hierarchy, and reducing duplication.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Vehicle:                       # Parent class\n",
        "      def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "          self.brand = brand\n",
        "      def start(self):\n",
        "          print(f\"{self.brand} vehicle is starting.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Car(Vehicle):                  # Child class inherits from Vehicle\n",
        "      def drive(self):\n",
        "          print(f\"{self.brand} car is driving.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Creating object of child class\n",
        "  my_car = Car(\"Tesla\")\n",
        "  my_car.start()   # Inherited method\n",
        "  my_car.drive()   # Child method\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method or operator in different ways.\n",
        "- It helps write flexible and reusable code, because the same interface can work with multiple types of objects.\n",
        "  - Example 1: Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "    class Animal:\n",
        "        def sound(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Some generic sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "        def sound(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "        def sound(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Meow\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n",
        "\n",
        "    for a in animals:\n",
        "        a.sound()   # same method name, different behavior\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  - Example 2: Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism). Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java (same method name, different parameters). But you can simulate it using default arguments.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "    class MathOps:\n",
        "      def multiply(self, a, b=1):\n",
        "          return a * b\n",
        "\n",
        "    m = MathOps()\n",
        "    print(m.multiply(5))      # 5*1 = 5\n",
        "    print(m.multiply(5, 3))   # 5*3 = 15\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Example 3: Operator Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "    print(5 + 10)      # adds numbers\n",
        "    print(\"Hi \" + \"Bye\")  # concatenates strings\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Point:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
        "        self.x = x\n",
        "        self.y = y\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __add__(self, other):\n",
        "        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    p1 = Point(2, 3)\n",
        "    p2 = Point(4, 5)\n",
        "    print(p1 + p2)  # adds 2 Point objects\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "    Here, + works differently depending on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and restricting direct access to its data. This ensures that the object’s data is protected from unauthorized changes.\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:\n",
        "  - Public (variable) → Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "  - Protected (_variable) → Accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "  - Private (__variable) → Accessible only within the class (name mangling used to prevent external access).\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class BankAccount:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "          self.__balance = balance  # private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "      def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "          self.__balance += amount\n",
        "\n",
        "      def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
        "          if amount <= self.__balance:\n",
        "              self.__balance -= amount\n",
        "          else:\n",
        "              print(\"Insufficient balance!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      def get_balance(self):\n",
        "          return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Creating an object\n",
        "  account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Accessing data via methods\n",
        "  account.deposit(500)\n",
        "  account.withdraw(300)\n",
        "  print(account.get_balance())  # 1200\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Direct access will cause error or is discouraged\n",
        "  # print(account.__balance)  # AttributeError\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved by making attributes private or protected and providing getter/setter methods to safely access or modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
        "- In Python, the constructor method is named __init__().\n",
        "-Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor\n",
        "          self.name = name\n",
        "          self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "      def display(self):\n",
        "          print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Creating an object (constructor is called automatically)\n",
        "  s1 = Student(\"Amit\", 21)\n",
        "  s1.display()\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- A class method is a method that works with the class itself, rather than an instance of the class.\n",
        "- It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "- The first parameter is cls, which refers to the class, not the object.\n",
        "- Useful for factory methods or methods that affect the class as a whole.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Employee:\n",
        "      company = \"ABC Corp\"\n",
        "\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "          self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "      @classmethod\n",
        "      def change_company(cls, new_company):\n",
        "          cls.company = new_company\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Using class method\n",
        "  Employee.change_company(\"XYZ Ltd\")\n",
        "  print(Employee.company)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- A static method does not access the class or instance directly.\n",
        "- It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "- It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class’s namespace.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class MathOps:\n",
        "      @staticmethod\n",
        "      def add(a, b):\n",
        "          return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(MathOps.add(5, 3))\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type).\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python is not natively supported, but can be simulated using default or variable-length arguments to make one method handle multiple input types or counts.\n",
        "- Python does not support true method overloading — the latest definition of a method overrides the previous ones.\n",
        "- Example (Simulated Method Overloading):\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class MathOps:\n",
        "      def add(self, a=0, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "          return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "  obj = MathOps()\n",
        "  print(obj.add(5))          # Output: 5\n",
        "  print(obj.add(5, 10))      # Output: 15\n",
        "  print(obj.add(5, 10, 15))  # Output: 30\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- Key Points:\n",
        "  - Python doesn’t support true compile-time overloading.\n",
        "  - You can achieve similar behavior using default parameters or *args and **kwargs.\n",
        "  - The latest defined method with the same name replaces earlier ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the same name as a method in its parent class, but provides a different implementation for it.\n",
        "- It allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class method.\n",
        "- This is a key feature of polymorphism, as it lets different classes respond differently to the same method call.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Animal:\n",
        "      def sound(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Some generic animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "      def sound(self):   # Overriding the parent class method\n",
        "          print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "      def sound(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Meow\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Creating objects\n",
        "  a1 = Animal()\n",
        "  d1 = Dog()\n",
        "  c1 = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "  a1.sound()  # Output: Some generic animal sound\n",
        "  d1.sound()  # Output: Bark\n",
        "  c1.sound()  # Output: Meow\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods in a class that allow you to access methods like attributes — without explicitly calling them like functions.\n",
        "- It helps in encapsulation by allowing controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```py\n",
        "  class Employee:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
        "          self._name = name          # Protected attribute\n",
        "          self._salary = salary\n",
        "\n",
        "      @property\n",
        "      def salary(self):\n",
        "          return self._salary        # Getter method\n",
        "\n",
        "      @salary.setter\n",
        "      def salary(self, value):\n",
        "          if value < 0:\n",
        "              raise ValueError(\"Salary cannot be negative\")\n",
        "          self._salary = value       # Setter method\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Using the class\n",
        "  emp = Employee(\"John\", 50000)\n",
        "  print(emp.salary)   # Accessing salary like an attribute → 50000\n",
        "  emp.salary = 60000  # Using setter to update value\n",
        "  print(emp.salary)   # 60000\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated through a common interface, even if they implement methods differently.\n",
        "It makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "- In simple terms, Polymorphism lets you write one function or method that can work with objects of multiple types — as long as they implement the same method name.\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important because it lets you write generic and flexible code that can work with different object types without knowing their exact classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes. It provides a template for subclasses, ensuring they follow a specific structure while leaving the actual implementation to them.\n",
        "- It defines common methods that must be implemented by its subclasses, but it cannot be instantiated itself.\n",
        "- In Python, abstract classes are created using the abc (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```py\n",
        "  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "      @abstractmethod\n",
        "      def speak(self):\n",
        "          pass  # Subclasses must implement this method\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "      def speak(self):\n",
        "          return \"Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  # animal = Animal()  # ❌ Error: Can't instantiate abstract class\n",
        "  dog = Dog()\n",
        "  print(dog.speak())  # ✅ Output: Woof!\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Code Reusability – You can reuse existing classes in new programs through inheritance, reducing duplication.\n",
        "- Modularity – Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
        "- Encapsulation – Data and methods are bundled together, keeping implementation details hidden and protecting data from unintended modification.\n",
        "- Abstraction – Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, improving clarity and reducing complexity.\n",
        "- Polymorphism – Allows the same function or method name to behave differently for different objects, increasing flexibility.\n",
        "- Maintainability – Since code is modular and reusable, it becomes easier to update or modify without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable is shared by all objects of the class. It is defined inside the class, but outside any method.\n",
        "- Instance variable is unique to each object (instance). It is defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  ```py\n",
